Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This is a simple program that takes a student's marks (a number between 0 and 100) and tells you what grade they got. The program will give you one of the following grades:

A for marks 80 or more
B for marks between 60 and 79
C for marks between 50 and 59
D for marks between 40 and 49
E for marks below 40

challenge 2: 
 Speed Detector
The goal of this challenge is to write a program that detects if a driver is speeding and calculates demerit points based on their speed.

Problem Overview:
The program will take the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80 km/h).
If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it should print "Ok".
If the speed is above 70 km/h, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit, the program will give the driver 1 demerit point.
If the driver gets more than 12 demerit points, the program should print "License suspended"

How the Program Works:
The program calculates the difference between the car's speed and the speed limit (70 km/h).
It then divides that difference by 5 to determine how many demerit points the driver should receive.
If the total demerit points exceed 12, the driverâ€™s license is suspended.

Challenge 3:
 Net Salary Calculator
This challenge involves calculating an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. The program will calculate various deductions such as tax (Pay As You Earn - PAYE), NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund), and NSSF (National Social Security Fund).

Problem Overview:
The program will take the basic salary and benefits as input.
It will calculate the following:
Gross Salary: The sum of basic salary and benefits.
PAYE: Tax deducted based on KRA (Kenya Revenue Authority) tax rates.
NHIF Deductions: Contributions to the National Hospital Insurance Fund.
NSSF Deductions: Contributions to the National Social Security Fund.
Net Salary: The final salary after all deductions.

How the Program Works:
It first calculates the Gross Salary by adding basic salary and benefits.
The program then calculates deductions for PAYE, NHIF, and NSSF based on the rates provided by the KRA, NHIF, and NSSF.
Finally, the Net Salary is calculated by subtracting all deductions from the gross salary.
Tax, NHIF, and NSSF Rates:
The tax, NHIF, and NSSF rates are based on the current rates from official sources (refer to the provided link in the code for more information).
